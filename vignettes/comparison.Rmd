# Identifying packages with new events relative to a prior build

We have introduced `new_events` and `becomes_OK` functions
to help assess differences in package state over time.

To use this, we need multiple ArtifSet instances.  This is
time-consuming so we just record a past application:
```
> rel_911 = setup_artifacts(date="2022-09-11", version="3.15")
starting untar...
done.

> rel_916 = setup_artifacts(date="2022-09-16", version="3.15")
starting untar...
done.
```

We indicate the type of event and the host name to get a report
on which packages have been revised to eliminate all errors between
9-11 and 9-16.

```
> becomes_OK(rel_911, rel_916, event="ERROR", host="nebbiolo1")
[1] "GSVA"        "NetSAM"      "netZooR"     "OrganismDbi" "PPInfer"    
[6] "pRoloc"      "TFHAZ"      
```

Here are some additional examples:
```
> new_events(rel_911, rel_916, event="ERROR", host="nebbiolo1")
[1] "BEclear"      "imageHTS"     "iPAC"         "martini"      "singleCellTK"

> new_events(rel_911, rel_916, event="ERROR", host="palomino3")
[1] "BEclear"      "martini"      "NuPoP"        "SCANVIS"      "singleCellTK"
[6] "Travel"      

> new_events(rel_911, rel_916, event="WARNINGS", host="palomino3")
[1] "edge"  "normr" "ORFik"
```

# Comparing package states across platforms

The `idiosync_status` function will report on 
packages that exhibit events of specific types
on only a subset of platforms in use.
